# Churn-Prediction
**Churn Prediction Web Application**
- This web application is deployed on streamlit 
- I have used the dataset from IBM community datasets which was a dataset from a fictional Telco Organization
- The Dataset has features representing the demographic data for each customer, the services used or not used by the customer and the churn labels for each customer as well
- The jupyter notebook file has the extensive EDA and all the preprocessing steps (handling missing values, null values, categorical data and balancing of the dataset)
- The model is saved as a .SAV file
- the data directory has the raw dataset as well as the preprocessed training features dataset, and the target dataset
